This lab is the first lab of EE300. It provided a chance for students to get familiar with the develop environment, developing with C and Arduino and the lab kits they are going to use in the whole quarter. In detail, they will need to use the provided kits and Arduino to learn how to make an LED blink correctly, how to control the LED with a button brick, how to send information to serial monitor on the PC, how to work with LCD as well as control it, how to communicate between two microprocessors by I2C ,and finally, how to control a microprocessor's LED by another's button.
