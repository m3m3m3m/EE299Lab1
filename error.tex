\subparagraph{lab 8}
We mistook A4 as D4 when we were building the circuit, but then we recognized it and correct our error.
We tried to use the BUS3 on the chassis at first(as the cookbook said), but it turned out that it is not working(we thought it wasn't connected to other circuits on the chassis board at all). So we used BUS1 instead, and it worked perfectly.
