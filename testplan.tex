\paragraph{Testplan for part 1}
	In part 1 of the lab, we learnt to use the laboratory and development environment, a combination of the traditional PC, Visual Studio, the Arduino UNO microcontroller and peripheral devices, and the Arduino integrated development environment (IDE), and how to work with a basic Blink program. The Blink program required us to make a LED light blink and use Arduino code and a button to control it. This requirement also contained being able to connect several peripherals, in this part a button and a LED, to the microprocessor. And finally we need to send output from a simple program to a display device, the Serial Monitor. So we will need to test if the blink statue of the controlled light meets the requirement, and if the output is correctly send to the Serial Monitor.\\
\paragraph{Testplan for part 2}
	In part 2 of the lab, we learnt to work with another display device, the LCD, and how to send information from one microprocessor, over a very simple network, to a second to control a peripheral device attached to the second microprocessor. Finally, we will need to control an LED of one microprocessor with another. As a result, we will need to test if the LCD can display correctly under our control, and if the two microprocessor can communicate correctly, and the LED light can be controlled from another microprocessor correctly.\\
